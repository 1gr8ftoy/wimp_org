## Overview

This website was the brain-child of my girlfriend who loves pets more than anything in the world (except me, hopefully).

She cannot stand the thought of owners being without their pets and vice-versa.

### Goal

One day we hope that this website will be used all over the United States.  We believe that it could be a good tool for use by pounds, shelters, owners and pet finders.

### Feedback
If you have an idea that would help make the website better and/or more useful, please feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/1gr8ftoy/wimp_org/issues/new) or contact us directly at <contact@whereismypet.org>.

We welcome all feedback.
